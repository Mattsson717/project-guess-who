# Project Name

This project we created a game of guess who. One secret person is selected from a group of 24 characters. The user then asks about the person from a pre-set list of questions and the group are then filtered based on the answer to the question. The user can continue to ask questions until they are ready to guess who the secret person is.

## The problem

I really struggled with the if else statemens when to include the arrays and compare it to the secret person.
But with help from my teamates and the technigo team I got it to work.
